<h2>Server Rules:</h2>
<b>Click the "Rules" tab at the top of this window and read them!
If you aren't aware of our rules, you could be warned by
an admin or jobbanned! Poor conduct as a member of the
security force/a head/a silicon will not be tolerated. These roles will be treated more harshly should rules be broken.</b>
<p>Keep IC in IC chat and OOC in OOC chat.  Please don't discuss ongoing rounds in OOC or you will be muted.</p>
<p>No killing, except in self defense, or as an antagonist (and show restraint even then).  Sitting around watching isn't fun.</p>
<p>For a good idea of antagonist knowledge and how to react in-character, see <a href="http://baystation12.net/wiki/index.php?title=Identifying_Antagonists">BS12's "Identifying Antagonists" page.</a></p>
<p>If you have a problem or a question, <b>adminhelp it!</b>
